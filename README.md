Enables other plugins to build queries with a builder class.

to create queries in a flexible, safe and easy way.

> Work in Progress!

## Usage
The idea is to use the db class to create a query, as demonstrated in this simple example:
```
$paul = db::table('user')->where('firstname', '=', 'Paul')
                         ->get();
```

- JSON Functions
- Update functionality
- Delete functionality
- Create functionality
